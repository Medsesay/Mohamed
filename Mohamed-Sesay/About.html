<h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE SECONDARY SCHOOL, LUNSAR</h2> <br>

<hr>

<p>The Our Lady of Guadalupe Secondary School Lunsar is an educational institution owned by the congregation of the Clarissan Missionary Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament who have Blessed Maria Ines as their foundress. The school was founded in 1965 by the
    Xaverian Missionaries, specifically the constructor Fr. Attillio Stefani of blessed memory, in response to the needs of girls who had completed their primary school education in the Our Lady of Guadalupe Primary school administered by the same congregation
    of sisters. The sisters had arrived in 1960 and immediately occupied themselves with the education of the girl child. Then, education for girls was very rare and parents refused to send their girls to school. The sisters embarked on a house to house
    crusade asking parents to send their girls to school. The responses were mixed as some parents sent their girls with little conviction while others bluntly told the sisters they had no funds to waste on such an enterprise. The refusing parents asked
    the sisters to go ahead and train the girls if they so desire (considering the whole enterprise a waste of time and resources) The sisters gladly accepted, and that, they have done since 1960 to date. This is how the whole story began. Having handed
    over the building to the sisters, the new school was named “Our Lady of Guadalupe Secondary Vocational School”. The aim was to offer intellectual and vocational courses to the girls, so that all may benefit; especially those who may not have the opportunity
    of furthering their education or may be forced to drop out of school. </p> <br>
